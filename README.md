## Imarat.ai
#### Constructing Intelligence, Building Efficiency.

## Why use Imarat.ai?
At construction sites, optimizing inventory management directly impacts productivity, enhances efficient asset utilization and facilitates smoother workflow management.

 Develop an AI management tool that optimizes asset utilization and monitoring tool maintenance considering factors like operational efficiency, resource availability, and equipment lifespan.

## Features
* Predictive Stock Replenishment
Detect out-of-stock resources in real-time and generate replenishment orders.
Use of Time Series Forecasting (DeepAR) Algorithm for forecasting the depletion level of assets at construction sites based on work type, amount and time for which the resources are used.
Analyze data on construction materials, including their properties, costs, and availability, to optimize material selection and usage. This helps reduce waste, control costs, and improve sustainability in construction projects.

* Intelligent Monitoring and Automation
AI-powered systems analyze real-time images or video feeds from construction sites. By leveraging computer vision algorithms(YOLO) , these systems identify and track specific elements, like completed tasks, installed components, condition of machines, the overall percentage of completion. 
Analyse to predict problems like labor shortages and foreseee construction risks in advance.
Analyze collected data to predict machine efficiency and send maintenance alerts.
This enables project managers to accurately assess site progress in real-time.


## Novelty of Idea

Risk Mitigation - Using AI prediction based on real time monitoring of construction site to detect safety hazards and issue real-time alerts to workers while notifying supervisors, engineers and managers of potential problems.

Augmented Reality (AR) Inventory Visualization: Enhances inventory management through AR for a 3D visualization, making it easier to manage and organize.

Quality Control and Defect Detection: Analyze images to detect defects,  or deviations from quality standards of machinery. Early identification of issues, enabling timely corrective actions and higher-quality construction outcomes.

Real-Time Updates and Alerts: Utilizes SMS and WhatsApp for instant stock level notifications, enabling quick replenishment to avoid running out of building material. Also addressing labour shortages by comparing amount of work.
